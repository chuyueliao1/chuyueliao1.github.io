In the leakage detection part based on infrared thermal images, due to uneven heating of the dam surface and the susceptibility of infrared thermal imaging technology to environmental factors during data acquisition, the overall imaging quality is low, severely affecting the accuracy of dam seepage point identification. To address these issues, I participated in designing a new method for dam seepage point detection based on infrared enhancement. By analyzing the characteristics of infrared image data and utilizing morphological reconstruction and automatic thresholding methods, it extracted the regions of minimum temperature in the infrared thermal images to construct a high-precision leakage identification model for dam infrared images.

This model has now been applied to a collaborative project with the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Water
Resources.
